            <p>
              We live in an age where our most powerful tools have become our greatest distractions. 
              Where checking a simple message leads to an hour-long scroll through digital noise. 
              Where the very devices designed to connect us leave us feeling more isolated than ever.

            <p>
              At GlitchOwt, we believe in a different path. We believe technology should amplify human 
              potential, not hijack human attention. We believe in interfaces that understand context, 
              conversations that create clarity, and tools that respect your time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong className="text-foreground">We believe in the power of voice.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Voice is intimate. Voice is efficient. Voice is human. When you speak, you engage with 
              ideas directlyâ€”no visual clutter, no endless options, no algorithmic manipulation. 
              Just pure, focused interaction.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-foreground font-medium">
              The future isn't about better screens. It's about transcending them entirely.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Join us. Help us build a world where technology serves humanity's highest potential. 
              Where every interaction is intentional. Where every moment of attention is sacred.
